# Free-Kick-Game
I worked within Visual Studio Code using JavaScript and CSS to create a hands-on game where users can click on the screen to “shoot the ball” at the goal. Key components of this project were creating a physics engine and implementing ray casting. I created a physics engine with ammo js that accounted for collisions, physics, and created a dynamic world.
